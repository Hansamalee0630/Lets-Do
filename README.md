# Functionaliy and topics used:

### Constraint Layout
Using constraint layout over legacy like Relative layout and Linear layout give more flexibility to app

### Custom RecyclerView 
Using RecyclerView with custom layout for elements gives more power of creativity and control over view.Showing all attributes of a task is only possible due to custom layout and custom adapter

### Data Binding
Use of data binding ensures that data is accessed properly and updated within the view.Use of Binding Adapters enables a creator to update the tasks on UI efficiently

### LiveData
Live data is used to update realtime values and thus update the ui. Using Live data with Data binding give a creater ability to update ui easily.

### View Binding
Some places where data binding seems tedious view binding is used.

### Room Database
All the information of task and their status is stored in room database. I have created 2 database :
1: To store all types of tasks and status for each task
2: To store status for daily tasks
